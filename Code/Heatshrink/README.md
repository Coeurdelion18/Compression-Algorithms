README

The file "heatshrink_implementation.cpp" contains the implementation of the heatshrink algorithm. If you want to run delta_encoding or double delta encoding, you can use it in the same file.

All the `.cpp` files, as well as any `.h` files with the same names, have been written by me. All others are files copied from the heatshrink source code from `https://github.com/atomicobject/heatshrink`. 

To allow static allocation of the encoder and decoder, the heatshrink_config file has been modified as per the instructions in atomicobject's github page.
